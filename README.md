Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

According to Mall, (2018) describes software engineering as a systematic collection of a good program development practices and techniques, an approach to develop software. A good program is a development techniques have resulted from research innovations as well as from the lessons learnt by programming experiences.
Traditional programming compared to software engineering refers to the conventional approach of writing code to create specific instructions for a computer to follow. It involves explicitly defining every step and condition, leaving no room for the system to learn or adapt independently. It bases its programming on rules and deterministic to the computer to perform specific tasks. Example to differential software engineering and traditional programming is attached on the link.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

According to Gagan Gurung .et al,(2020) The cycle consist of: 
Requirements analysis,It is when information gathered is converted into clear requirements for development team.
System design plan is elaborated into software design document that includes what programming language to use, what measures are placed on security.
Implementation ,it’s when developers divide project into software modules turning it into software requirement code that will result into product.
Testing this includes quality assurance team to perform validation testing to ensure proper functioning of system and its intended use. 
Deployment ensuring the final product is delivered to its intended user 
Maintenance In this final stage, the users can find bugs, errors that was missed in the testing phase.
https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-development-life-cycle/ Includes planning, it is when developers gather requirements from clients. They evaluate if it is feasible to create a product, cost production and time needed to create the product.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model is used to facilitate quick project completion. It decomposes the requirements into many small parts that can be incrementally developed. Incremental part is developed over iteration. Agile relies on working software 
deployment rather than comprehensive documentation. Process is divided into sprints.  Continuous client interaction and feedback. More flexible in making changes, hence to be used in large projects. Short delivery time and very quick functional software. 
While Gagan Gurung .et al,(2020) further on to say Waterfall models is one of the oldest software development life cycle model that is not used much in the recent years. Progress is seen in a downwards flowing in a developing phase while using a linear sequence. For It to progress, it requires data collected from earlier phase. And waterfall model is used in small projects because they is little room for revisions once the project is finished.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

According to Rolland .et al, (2000) explains requirements engineering explores the objectives of different stakeholders and the activities carried out by them to meet these objectives in order to derive purposeful system requirements and therefore lead to better quality systems, i.e., systems that meet the requirements of their users. Thus RE product models use concepts for modelling these instead of concepts like data, process, events, etc., used in conceptual models. 
Macaulay, L.A., (2012.pg 7) states that they are five stages to requirements engineering process namely concept, problem analysis, feasibility and choice, modelling of application and requirements document. In concept software development is the trigger for the requirements process to begin. So in developing a software, developers need to understand the nature of the problem and come up with solutions. The feasibility and choice of the software development is determined with evaluating cost and benefits by using an alternative solution. Software development should be validated so as to check the accuracy of data gathered then the requirement documentation is completed. The lifecycle is important because it provides a framework for developers to manage development process systematically with clear goals and deliverable at every stage. It improves cost estimation and risk management, it’s an approach that meets customer expectations and satisfaction

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is an approach where complex software is divided into components that uses independent modules, such as functions or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts. It makes coding readable and easy maintenance.
Modularity can significantly enhance both maintenance and scalability of software by breaking apart software into distinct modules so that developers can manage, update, and scale parts of the application independently, leading to low cost maintenance and efficient upgrading over lifetime of product. (Baldwin, C.Y. and Clark, K.B., 1994. pg 1-44)

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing is the most important kind of verification testing for the individual programmer. It is a process a programmer uses to test each unit of software. Acceptance testing it refers to testing done by the clients or anyone on their behalf to ensure the program is running as specified, if this part of testing fails then the client has a right to reject the program. (Tsui, F., Karam, O. and Bernal, B., 2022). Integration testing is when two or more modules that are a unit and are integrated for testing. Interface errors are detected and determine if a module works as per expectations or not. While system testing is when the integrated and completed software is tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Zolkifli, N.N. et al (2018.pp408-415 ) states that version control system is a system that manages development of an evolving object meaning it is a system used by software developers to record any changes made. It is important because it allows old version of code to be stored in the version control system repository, allows recovery accidental deletions, enable individuals to conserve and save disk space on both source control client and on the server. Also allows individuals to work any file anytime without overlapping others work by writing over others code. Some of the popular examples of version control systems are: local version control -changes are stored locally in files as patch before pushed to a single version code in database :Central version control- users can aceess these versions and push,pull changes as needed (Team foundation server, subversion) :Distributed version control- most sophisticated of the three, local repository fully mirrors the central repository ,including history.(GIT,mercurial,Bit keeper)

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A project manager is an individual who is involved in software development projects while involved in managing teams by being a leader, team builder,planner,influencer, decision maker ,planner and a coach.(Shastri, Y., Hoda, R. and Amor, R., 2021.pp110871).Challenges faced by project managers in software development is that knowledge between a client and a supplier is not easily available and there is a general gap between business professionals and software professionals it has widen organisational boundaries. Spending more time with the customer so as to understand business objectives and what are customers real needs are. Also poor communication can arise within the team members due to a minor misunderstanding, Poor budget allocation. Project managers are responsible for establishing effective communication by formulating a detailed communication plan, holding a team member accountable for their actions, involve themselves in the planning phases to ensure the client's goals and objectives are met and that the project has enough resources e.g. budget so as to complete the project effectively.(Savolainen, P. and Ahonen, J.J., 2015.p92-102)


Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance has been recognized as the most demanding and costly phase in the software life cycle. Software maintenance tasks, although require a more complex set of skills and knowledge, are far less interesting to software engineers than software development tasks (Stojanov, Z., 2021. pp 182-197).According to Kaur, U. and Singh, G., (2015. pp 6-11) talks about maintenance activities as: Corrective maintenance is usually used for emergency program that routinely debugg and fixes program. Adaptive maintenance used to make changes in response to technology changes.Perfective maintenance used to improve documented and requested enhancement. Preventive maintenance identification and correction of latent problems in a software system.(Stojanov, Z., 2021. pp 182-197).it is important because it facilitates documentation preparedness when an issue arises, has good security measures, saves time and always updated.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues faced by software engineers are, collecting data unethically, algorithm bias when the system developers create shows unintentional bias. Software industries have more concerning security issues due to developers lack of education to learn and implement standard security practices. Software engineers prioritise wrongly by shifting focus to creating new function and features while neglecting the improvement of existing functions.
Marebane, S.M. and Hans, R.T. (2023.pp 504-516) says to overcome the ethical challenges a software engineer needs to have ethical competence by combining knowledge ,skills,attitude and this can be acquired through training in ethics. Also ethically responsible by being accountable for any consequences relating to the software development by committing to performance of good quality work and to object to decisions that are not in line with their professional standards. And continuous monitoring of level of professional responsibility by means of training. And lastly being honest and proactive when writing their codes.
